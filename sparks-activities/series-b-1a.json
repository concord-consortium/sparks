              "feedback": "Bravo! The total resistance increases with additional bulbs. Ohmâ€™s Law tells us that the battery  will then deliver less current. And that means less power output by each bulb.<br><br> You can advance to the next level."

              "feedback": "No, actually resistors in   series will add their values. The total resistance when connected in series is greater. How will that make the circuit behave? Try again."
