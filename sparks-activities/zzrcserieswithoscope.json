          "prompt": "Here are two RC circuits and an oscilloscope. The oscilloscope and the function generator share a common ground which is connected to the black lead of the function generator. Note that one of the oscilloscope probes (the yellow one) is permanently attached to ground so the oscilloscope measures all voltages with respect to ground. <br> <br> The two circuits are subtly different. In the upper circuit the resistor is attached to the red lead of the function generator, in the lower circuit it is the capacitor that is attached to the red lead of the function generator.<br> <br>This means that if you connect the probe to the junction between the resistor and the capacitor then in the upper circuit you are measuring the voltage across the resistor (which is proportional to the current through the circuit). But if you do the same measurement with the lower circuit you are measuring the voltage across the capacitor.<br> <br>Set the frequency on the function generator and then make the measurements below.",
