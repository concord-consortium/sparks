          "prompt": "Tidewater Community College and Professor Al Koon have adopted an exciting new project called <b>SPARKS: Simulations for Performance Assessments that Report on Knowledge and Skills</b> to be part of your electronics course.  This project, funded by the National Science Foundation, helps students learn various topics in electronics by giving them realistic problems to solve on a computer.  Students receive instant feedback and detailed reporting as they work to develop their skills on the SPARKS modules.  This project is being run by The Concord Consortium, a non-profit educational research company located in Concord, Massachusetts and CORD, located in Waco, Texas.</br></br>Although your professor and school have adopted this project, for us to gather data from you (answers to questions, computer logs), we require your signed consent. Your permission to participate in this project means that you may be observed during your regular class time; you may be asked to answer some questions about the assessment process in the form of pencil and paper surveys, and you may be interviewed.</br></br>Participation is not required and if you do not participate or decide to withdraw from the study, there will be no negative effect on your grade in the course.  If you do participate, all identifying data will be removed from all written documentation and you will be assigned a unique identification number.  A list of identification numbers and corresponding student names will be kept in a locked file cabinet. </br></br>If you have any questions, you may contact Principal Investigator, Dr. Paul Horwitz, at 978-405-3223.  You may also contact Dr. Andrew Zucker, Chair of the Human Subjects Institutional Review Board of the Concord Consortium, at 978-405-3231.</br></br>Have you read the above and are you willing to participate in this study?",
