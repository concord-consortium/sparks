              "feedback": "Bravo! The total resistance increases with additional bulbs. Ohmâ€™s Law tells us that the battery will then deliver less current. And that means less power output by each bulb."

              "option": "More bulbs in series quickly shorts out the battery, and so, soon the bulbs quit emitting light.",
